<p> some notes about creative usage of this webpage. 
[would be great to embed the pageNN.html of the matching indexNN.html, and embed that in an iframe somewhere in this page. however i don't yet know how to do that in html]

<p>

	From the beginning of this course, I approached my learning process by experimenting with documentation. The intention, at the outset, was perhaps just simply to continue on from previous experiments with documentation of the ontogenesis (Boesch 182) of a project, as described in [citation and link for dvcs and research-creation, and the accelerationism and version control papers.] 
<p> 


For Pink, "A methodology based in and a commitment to understanding the senses provides a route to forms of knowledge and knowing not accounted for in conventional forms of ethnography. It often leads us to the normally not spoken, the invisible and the unexpected -- those things that people do not perhaps neessarily think it would be worth mentioning, or those things that tend to be felt or sensed ratber than spoken about." (Pink 53)

<a href="index1.html">This is how the document began, as an abandoned attempt at writing a web page for my presentation in class on Sarah Pink's Sensory Ethnography.</a>




<p> <a name="modulation"> note to self, go to page 30 of pink and insert your marginalia and shimojo and shams and newell and shams. </a>

<p><h2> Learning </h2>

	For example, following Wenger's position that "...learning ... [is] the ability to negotiate new meanings," I have create explicit links between notes in this document to augment this. i.e. 
	<p> Linking <a href="#modulation">modulation to</a> where Pink notes that "...Seremetakis suggests that 'sensory memory or the mediation on the historical substance of experience is not mere repetition but transformation that brings the past inot the present as a natal event. (1994: 7)" (Pink 44)

can you make hyperlinks to different sections of the html document. for example, allowing you to make explicit links between how you  make connections within idea of the book.
