<p> some notes about creative usage of this webpage. 
	<br>
[would be great to embed the pageNN.html of the matching indexNN.html, and embed that in an iframe somewhere in this page. however i don't yet know how to do that in html]

<p>

	From the beginning of this course, I approached my learning process by experimenting with documentation. The intention, at the outset, was perhaps just simply to continue on from previous experiments with documentation of the ontogenesis (Boesch 182) of a project, as described in [citation and link for dvcs and research-creation, and the accelerationism and version control papers.] These earlier papers explore the creative potential of leveraging an already established archival system that is used by teams of programmers to manage the changes made to a given project towards expanded uses for research-creation. I enrolled in the Performance Ethnography course because I wanted to expand my usage of version control sytems through a type of enquiry that, as turned out to be oft-repeated in class, is not a method ...

	<p> 
		The mechanisms of version control systems concern the way in which the changes to a work are represented. Where Professor Kazubowski-Houston told us at during the first class that 
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			A lot of performance ethnography has been to communicate research findings. a more rare approach is using performance ethnography to use it as a way of doing research, as a form of a research-creation practice. (CITE, during week 1)
			</BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<p>
			It is in this that VCS is well-suited to ethnographic practice. To use a version control system is to engage with, structure, and learn from the history of a process and the contemporaneous sentiments about its produced artifacts, people, and their exchanges (CITE dCOG).
		 
<p> 

	<br>What tended to emerge over the course of the past 4 months of in-class discussions was a sentiment about embracing the messy, unpredictable, and asynchronous tendencies of ethnographic research. [such as?] I was inspired by this very early on. And as I have been increasingly using a web browser as the delivery method and medium of my research papers, I grew emboldened by to represent both the 'finished' -- albeit probably best described as 'most recent' -- version along with all of its precedent versions in some form of non-linear or asynchronous fashion. I wondered if perhaps this would mean that upon first visiting this web page, a visitor would be taken to a random version of the page. However, would I make it possible to then navigate both forward and backward in time through different page states? Would I not provide this option, leaving the reader to have to refresh the page and look at the next version to load? 
	<p>
	I became interested in the prospect of presenting a 'finished work' in both linear and non-linear forms. 


<p> 
	For instance, during the latter few classes of the course, in-class notes were taken using Sangwon Lee's <i>Live Writing</i> interface, as can be seen here:

	http://livewriting.eecs.umich.edu/?aid=YUdyxM7qIA74QMRSv14B

	<p> It is worthwhile to point out that from each experiment in form and representation came at least one desire to try and use this form somewhat differently the next time. For example, after using the Live Writing website for a few note-taking sessions, I began to want to embed the playback in a web page. This was motivated by wanting a visitor to remain on the page instead of linking outward. However, due to a security restriction placed by Lee into that website's code [what was the name of that problem? something to do with allowing embedding in iframes? search notes for this] this simply was not going to be possible.
		<p> I had been introduced to Sangwon just one week previously, and so in response to my request for assistance in embedding the playback of my writing in a page, he recommended that I try using a similar tool called Scrimba. Lee and the developers of Scrimba have differnt goals in mind for their work, but what their projects share is the ability to capture the input of text in real-time, and allow anyone to play it back. Where they differ, is that Lee's project is better suited towards creative and/or limited research writing, while Scrimba is designed for live programming, which is an educational tool. With Scrimba, I was suddenly able to write again in HTML, and render it to a webpage all within the same recording. I used it thusly in the <a href="https://blackcreekscores.weebly.com"><i>Black Creek Scores</i></a> project to create a <a href="https://blackcreekscores.weebly.com/#score_3">short text and image-based graphic score</a> of my path through the creek and some of the thoughts I had along the way. 
			<p>
				[[maybe say a little about what this taught you, or made you think of next?]]
		<p>I had intended to return to this very same tool to write the entirety of this paper. However, there were a few concerns. What if the Scrimba website produced an error during the recording, would I lose my work? With no information available related to the maximum length of a recording, would it be worth it to risk losing potentially entire pages of work by pushing this neat tool beyond its yet unkown limit? While some of my recent other works have each been crafted in the name of embracing and exploring failure, the fact that this ethnography carried a looming deadline pursuaded me to find another solution. 

		<p>Following a critical reflexivity, I also questioned the intention and effect of presenting the entire writing process in one singular, linear representation. Who would this serve? Through this I became conscious of a desire to perform a level of intelligence and 'put-together-ness'. While the video would purport to present my entire mental process as that of written text, it could not capture 

		 show all thoughts I wrote down within that time frame, it would certainly not be able to include the entirety of my

		[engagement and positionality] 

			What purpose would knowing the length of a process serve? I am less concerned with the macrotemporal (macrogestural) length of a project, a value which could also be derived by  means other than a linear, potentially very long recording, than by the n-temporal segments in between. This particular problem offered a new way of approaching the work. 

			<p> for the bulk of the writing of this ethnography, I wanted to have a copy of every single saved state of the paper [[and, WHY did you want this? how to relate to course material?]]. I then had the idea to have each state represented in html rendered as a page -- like the final version would be -- but also to verbosely label the changes between each of the states, a form of documentation referred to as delta encoding. (cite) 
	<br>[[more on delta encoding later? With delta encoding, ]] 





		<p> and taking from the ethic of the radical engineer, to always be questionning how a tool can be used differently. (cite the guy who wrote the article on alan kay?)

For Pink, "A methodology based in and a commitment to understanding the senses provides a route to forms of knowledge and knowing not accounted for in conventional forms of ethnography. It often leads us to the normally not spoken, the invisible and the unexpected -- those things that people do not perhaps neessarily think it would be worth mentioning, or those things that tend to be felt or sensed ratber than spoken about." (Pink 53)



<a href="index1.html">This is how the document began, as an abandoned attempt at writing a web page for my presentation in class on Sarah Pink's Sensory Ethnography.</a>

<p><h2> Learning </h2>

	For example, following Wenger's position that "...learning ... [is] the ability to negotiate new meanings," I have create explicit links between notes in this document to augment this. i.e. 
	<p> Linking <a href="#modulation">modulation to</a> where Pink notes that "...Seremetakis suggests that 'sensory memory or the mediation on the historical substance of experience is not mere repetition but transformation that brings the past inot the present as a natal event. (1994: 7)" (Pink 44)

can you make hyperlinks to different sections of the html document. for example, allowing you to make explicit links between how you  make connections within idea of the book.
