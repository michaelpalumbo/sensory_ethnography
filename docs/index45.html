<p> some notes about creative usage of this webpage. 
	<br>
[would be great to embed the pageNN.html of the matching indexNN.html, and embed that in an iframe somewhere in this page. however i don't yet know how to do that in html]

<p>

	From the beginning of this course, I approached my learning process by experimenting with documentation. The intention, at the outset, was perhaps just simply to continue on from previous experiments with documentation of the ontogenesis (Boesch 182) of a project, as described in [citation and link for dvcs and research-creation, and the accelerationism and version control papers.] These earlier papers explore the creative potential of leveraging an already established archival system that is used by teams of programmers to manage the changes made to a given project towards expanded uses for research-creation. I enrolled in the Performance Ethnography course because I wanted to expand my usage of version control sytems through a type of enquiry that, as turned out to be oft-repeated in class, is not a method ...

	<p> 
		The mechanisms of version control systems concern the way in which the changes to a work are represented. Where Professor Kazubowski-Houston told us at during the first class that 
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			A lot of performance ethnography has been to communicate research findings. a more rare approach is using performance ethnography to use it as a way of doing research, as a form of a research-creation practice. (CITE, during week 1)
			</BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<p>
			It is in this that VCS is well-suited to ethnographic practice. To use a version control system is to engage with, structure, and learn from the history of a process and the contemporaneous sentiments about its produced artifacts, people, and their exchanges (CITE dCOG).
		 
<p> 

<p> for the bulk of the writing of this ethnography, I wanted to have a copy of every single saved state of the paper [[and, WHY did you want this? how to relate to course material?]]. I then had the idea to have each state represented in html rendered as a page -- like the final version would be -- but also to verbosely label the changes between each of the states, a form of documentation referred to as delta encoding. (cite) 
	<br>[[more on delta encoding later? With delta encoding, ]] 
	<br>What tended to emerge over the course of the past 4 months of in-class discussions was a sentiment about embracing the messy, unpredictable, and asynchronous tendencies of ethnographic research. [such as?] I was inspired by this very early on. And as I have been increasingly using a web browser as the delivery method and medium of my research papers, I grew emboldened by to represent both the 'finished' -- albeit probably best described as 'most recent' -- version along with all of its precedent versions in some form of non-linear or asynchronous fashion. I wondered if perhaps this would mean that upon first visiting this web page, a visitor would be taken to a random version of the page. However, would I make it possible to then navigate both forward and backward in time through different page states? Would I not provide this option, leaving the reader to have to refresh the page and look at the next version to load? 
	<p>
	I became interested in the prospect of presenting a 'finished work' in both linear and non-linear forms.

For Pink, "A methodology based in and a commitment to understanding the senses provides a route to forms of knowledge and knowing not accounted for in conventional forms of ethnography. It often leads us to the normally not spoken, the invisible and the unexpected -- those things that people do not perhaps neessarily think it would be worth mentioning, or those things that tend to be felt or sensed ratber than spoken about." (Pink 53)



<a href="index1.html">This is how the document began, as an abandoned attempt at writing a web page for my presentation in class on Sarah Pink's Sensory Ethnography.</a>

<p><h2> Learning </h2>

	For example, following Wenger's position that "...learning ... [is] the ability to negotiate new meanings," I have create explicit links between notes in this document to augment this. i.e. 
	<p> Linking <a href="#modulation">modulation to</a> where Pink notes that "...Seremetakis suggests that 'sensory memory or the mediation on the historical substance of experience is not mere repetition but transformation that brings the past inot the present as a natal event. (1994: 7)" (Pink 44)

can you make hyperlinks to different sections of the html document. for example, allowing you to make explicit links between how you  make connections within idea of the book.
