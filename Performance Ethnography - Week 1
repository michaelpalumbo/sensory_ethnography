ethnography as a social critique

sound ethnography. using no sound (silence) as a way of conducting research. researching silence

what is ethnography?
	- traditionally ethnography has been essential in defining research methodology
		- THIS ethnography is not a method, its a methodology

		culture is a shallow word. what do we mean by culture what 'this is how people live their lives' ? culturies are not discrete entities, they are intersecting, and are largely the product of western colonial interventions. 

		its not that anthropologists have somehow become so generous to adopt better practices, its that people in other cultures have been pushing back. 

		no such a thing as objective observation, or objective science. your context always influences the work. the mere fact by which you ask research questions, your question is affected by the economy, your position in teh world, etc. anthropologists can each ask the same question, but their results will be different because they are different.
			- this leads into reflexivity
			- called the crisis of representation

Performance ethnography began with Victor Turner & Richard Schechner
	- conducting fieldwork ... staging representations of their fieldwork in theatrical performances.
	- performance began to be taken seriously as a result of victor turner's work. 
		- ways in which people engage in identity construction
		- ways in which people construct meaning. 
		- performance and play was considered secondary, but this changed with Turner's work. 
	Magda points out that this is problematic though, because there are issues with power and representation. 
		- a lot of perf eth has been to communicate research findings. a more rare approach is using perf eth to use it as a way of doing research, as a form of a research-creation practice. 
This will not be a history of performance ethnography. 

if you want to research fast, you shouldn't do ethnography. ethnography is not talking to only a few people. 

what is social justice research? how can we even claim that we can make a profound change at the social level?

ethnography tries to undo the neoliberal academic moment that is trying to pay attention to pace and move quickly
	- suddenly ethnography became very popular in the academy. 
		- at first anthropologists were very excited, 
			- in the neoliberal academy every discipline is trying to defend its turf


METHODOLOGY IS A SENSIBILITY, IT IS NOT A HOW-TO. 
	- ethnography is a methodology because it is improvisational. 
	- its about a long-term commitment with the people that we are studying. 
	- yes, the researcher gets published, they get accolades, but its about giving back to the community you are researching. 


its very important to think about how we represent artists. consider if they are coming from a minority population, you as a phd are claiming that voice. even if you try to be committed to them.


collaborative research can sometimes be more dangerous. sometimes its just a way of masking academic/scholarly exploitation. 


how can we use performance ethnography in undoing the power regimes in neoliberal academia, the competitiveness, the insanity behind the publish/produce or perish. 

also want to problematize the idea of activism. activism for whom? whom does it benefit? 
	- magda gave a story of many elder Roma women not wanting her to write newspaper articles, or going to the local government, because if she did so, the authorities would burn down the homes of the elders. 
	- being in graduate school doesn't make you special. anyone could do it given the right resources and time. 

Magda gets lost in academic neoliberalism, its depressing. 

a danger of the neoliberalism is that we put things in black and white, does this have an effect on my career, etc. 

how do you know what your performance did without talking to others. but even if you do ask, what do you think they'll tell you? 'oh i liked it' etc. sometimes we have to conduct a post-performance ethnography. the effect of the perofrmance may not come up until years later.

we do take funding, and we make certain claims, and certain commitments, and then what?


not everyone has to think about doing activism.
