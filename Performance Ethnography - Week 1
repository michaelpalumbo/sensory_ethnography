what is ethnography?
	- traditionally ethnography has been essential in defining research methodology
		- THIS ethnography is not a method, its a methodology

		culture is a shallow word. what do we mean by culture what 'this is how people live their lives' ? culturies are not discrete entities, they are intersecting, and are largely the product of western colonial interventions. 

		its not that anthropologists have somehow become so generous to adopt better practices, its that people in other cultures have been pushing back. 

		no such a thing as objective observation, or objective science. your context always influences the work. the mere fact by which you ask research questions, your question is affected by the economy, your position in teh world, etc. anthropologists can each ask the same question, but their results will be different because they are different.
