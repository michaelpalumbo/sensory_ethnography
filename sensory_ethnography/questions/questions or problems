Pink throws the term 'global' out without providing a definition, or multiple definitions. How useful is this term?


similarly, she regers to something called 'our total environment' (62). Is she referring to one which we can only sense in the immediate, or does the ways in which our sense modalities are extended by memory, imagination, (etc?) also act upon this environment in totality?
