the problem of 'authenticity' of an author/researcher and their work. "challenges to the anthropologist as producer of text, and to place as a container of culture" (Coleman and Collins 2006:2)

"dislocation of a fixed role between culture and place." (Pink 33)
	- culture is not a closed system, nore can it be delineated according to spatial boundaries (Pink 33)

		Pink's two questions on the 'theoretical and methodolical issues' (ibid) related to this problem:

			1. 	"how can place be defined if it is something that is not fixed or enclosed, that is constituted as much through the flows that link it to other locations, persons and things, as it is through what foes on 'inside' it?"
			2. "...given that places are continually constituted, rather than fied, then how can we understand the role of the emplaced ethnographer as a participant in and eventually author of the places she or he studies? This question requires thinking about both the politics and power relations that flobal flows entail and attending to the detail of our eeryday embodied and sensory engagements in our environments. As such it requires that analitically we examine the politics and phenomenology of space and place." (ibid)
