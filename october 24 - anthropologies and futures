	how does the researcher presenting a methodology affect the power dynamic. should participants be involved in co-creating the methodology and how does this affect the power dynamic?

short term ethnography: what is long term ethnography 

is there a future orientation in short-term 

>>>THIS: word-for-word of my thoughts on the discussion of short-term and long-term: seems that short-term ethnography is future-oriented, right? its declared at the outset, or in the proposition of an outset. but i wonder in doing long-term ethnography, does not preclude short-termness. through a past-orientation that sees events as segmentations of the macro-temporality. does this get into thinking that what is longterm is the genealogy of the research or discours(es)?
	- and further, and this relates to my own nascent research and writing methodology, that this compels one to consider long-term ethnography as a temporal distribution of research contributions over lifetimes, how does short- and longterm- ethnography prepare a researcher for developing a methodology that better serves not only past and contemporaneous collaborators, but those who encounter one's ideas in the future?
